Let me explain the difference between Runnable and Callable.

Characteristics of Runnable
1. Defines run() method and has no arguments.
2. CheckedException cannot be thrown.
3. Use to define what you want to run on a thread.
4. When the operation is completed, no results will be returned.

Characteristics of Callable
1. Defines the call() method, with no arguments, results and exception syntax.
2. You can throw CheckedException exceptions.
3. Used for tasks that return results and require exception handling.
4. Return the result when the operation is complete and track the result with Future.


[Example Code]

class RunnableEx implements Runnable {
  public void run() {
    //no results or Exception
 }
}

class CallableEx implements Callable(Integer) {
  public Integer call() throws Exception {
    //results & Exception
    return 10;
 }
}
